    Design and describe a web platform that cultivates education, wisdom, and meaningful engagement over shallow entertainment.

    The platform is social, transparent, and aspirational: everyone’s intellectual journey is public, and their history, ratings, and scores are open for others to see and learn from.

    The platform helps users:

        Track their intellectual growth over time

        Discover mind-expanding media

        Review, reflect on, and adjust their own ratings and critiques

        Connect with others based on their guiding questions, media habits, and contributions

        Contribute thoughtful content to the community

🌟 Mission

Build a media and social platform centered around curiosity, wisdom, and accountability — encouraging users to choose content that grows them and to think critically about what they consume.
